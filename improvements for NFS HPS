Kings, Gamers and W*men, I have finished the mod and here are my suggestions of how the mod could be improved for future updates:
- I felt like some cars added were out of place, like the Countach, it being one of, if not the only classic car in the (main) game. It doesn't really fit the vibe of Hot Pursuit in my opinion. The SL500 also felt like a poor choice to leave in from Vanilla Most Wanted, the SL65 would've been much more appropriate in my eyes.
- The extra cars are good, but I feel like it can be taken further with even more cars. I hate to be that guy and suggest adding Japanese cars, but provided they are period correct, a few here and there wouldn't go a miss. Maybe the Skyline GT-R R34 and Honda NSX (as they was in some of the pre-tuner NFS games). I also like the idea of some cars that are throwbacks to some of the older NFS games; Mercedes SLK230 and BMW Z3 immediately spring to mind as starter cars (the Z3 could be subbed for the M Roadster)
- I was somewhat underwhelmed by the bonus event after finishing the main career mode. I feel like a secret car at the end could've had so much potential, and the car used felt out of place in the game and was a bit of a limp reward. Think outside the box and get creative. Maybe a car chase mimicking an iconic movie, maybe use another heat level to introduce exclusive cop cars for that chase.
- The cutscene races that aren't actually races, these could be turned into additional events, like maybe a car chase post-race
- The numberplates need to be a bit more uniform in my eyes. ALSO WHY IS THE FRONT PLATE ON THE 360 SPIDER YELLOW?!
- In one of the events, the Lotus Esprit police chase, the car turned ghost-mode
- Would like more cutscenes like the ones before and after the big story races
- I feel like having the intro cutscene playing for every opening class race is unnecessary. Perhaps just unlock one race, play the cutscene, and the following ones don't need anything after
Hope you take this on board
